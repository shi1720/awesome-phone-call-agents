# offline path builds a real `calle.CalleClient` from the pinned `calle-ai` package and every
# request is constructed, sent, parsed and raised by CALL-E's own code. Only the transport is
# local, because `CalleClient` takes an injectable httpx client and the double is mounted on
# it. A reader who is told a run is offline and not told that will reasonably assume the SDK
# was stubbed out, and the whole point of the double is that it is not.

# enrolled pupil instead of the day's absentees. The idempotency key protects the second run
# and does nothing for the first, because every row is a different child.
