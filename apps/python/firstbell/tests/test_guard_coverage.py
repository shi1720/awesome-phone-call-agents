"""Rules that had stopped being rules, found by deleting every guard and seeing who cared.

`FundingRate.__post_init__` required a `source` and no test failed when the requirement was
removed. The requirement was still in the code and still in the documentation, and it had
quietly become a sentence. Nothing distinguishes that from a rule anybody relies on until
somebody tries deleting it.

So it was done mechanically for all of them. Every `if` in `firstbell/`, `dispatch/` and
`calle_double/` whose body only raises or short-circuits, and every `assert`, was
neutralised one at a time and the whole suite run against the result. A guard whose removal
costs nothing is not protecting anything.

Each test below names the guard it exists for, by file and line as the file stood when this
was written, and the failure that guard is the only thing preventing. Each was then checked
the same way it was found: the guard was deleted again, and the named test had to fail.

Four of the sweep's findings are deliberately not tested, because no input can tell them
from the code around them, and a test written for one of those would be a test that passes
whatever the code does:

  * the two `assert` statements in `ImpactSummary.lines` narrow a type inside a branch
    that has already established the value is not None;
  * `run`'s `if not callable_items: return report` short-circuits to the same report the
    loop below it would produce for an empty list;
  * `_handle`'s cancel check reads the same expression `_create_with_retries` reads a
    moment later, so deleting either alone changes nothing;
  * `_create_with_retries`'s `if err.code in PERMANENT_ERRORS` returns the same result the
    line below it returns, because `PERMANENT_ERRORS` and `RETRYABLE_ERRORS` are disjoint.
    That one was not assumed: it was deleted, and `test_an_error_that_retrying_cannot_fix_
    does_not_redial` still passed, which is what redundant means here.

They are recorded rather than dropped, because "nothing noticed" and "nothing could" are
different answers and only one of them is a defect.
