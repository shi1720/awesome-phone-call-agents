"""Dispatch phone work in waves, and be able to stop.

Three properties of CALL-E shape everything in this file:

1. **There is no cancel endpoint.** Once `POST /v1/calls` is accepted, that call is going
   to happen. The docs say so plainly: "a call that is already in flight may therefore
   continue to completion even when your application no longer needs its result." So
   cancellation cannot mean "stop the calls". It can only mean stop dispatching new ones,
   wait for the ones already out, and report honestly which could not be recalled. That is
   what `cancel()` does, and the report names them.

2. **The docs warn against dispatching everything at once**: "For workflows that need only
   a target number of confirmations, dispatch calls in controlled waves instead of
   starting every call at once." With no cancel endpoint, the concurrency cap is the only
   brake that exists, so it is not a tuning parameter, it is the safety mechanism.

3. **A recipients array of N dials N people.** One request, N billed calls, and no way to
   take them back. So the cap is enforced on people, not on requests.

The submission repository's own PR checklist requires "Recurring workflows include
cancellation behavior", which the platform underneath does not provide. This is where that
requirement is met.

        Every exit from the create loop that is not a call object used to be FAILED, and
        FAILED is a sentence: nobody was reached, nothing will be billed, and the office
        can put the row on tomorrow's list. That sentence is false the moment an earlier
        attempt has gone out and not come back, because that request may have arrived and
        started a telephone ringing.

        The sequence is ordinary rather than exotic. Attempt one times out. Attempt two
        reaches the platform and is refused, most likely with `invalid_phone`, which is a
        permanent error and returns immediately. The row was then reported FAILED with a
        `failure_code` in `NEVER_CARRIED`, so the run told a reader the platform refused
        the call and nothing was carried, about a call that may have been carried and will
        appear on the bill. A later attempt answering does not retract an earlier attempt
        that did not.

        So once placement is unknown it stays unknown, and `possibly_placed_key` travels
        with it: that key is the only handle anybody has to reconcile the row against the
        vendor's own record, and it is what lets a re-run replay the request rather than
        place a second call.

        `failure_code` is deliberately left off this result. `NEVER_CARRIED` is already
        gated on FAILED, so the arithmetic is safe either way, but `cli.py` collects
        `idempotency_conflict` on the code alone and prints "nothing was dialled again"
        about whatever it finds. A definite sentence about an ambiguous row is the defect
        this method exists to stop, and it must not come back through a consumer that
        reads the code without the resolution. The code is in the reason instead, where a
