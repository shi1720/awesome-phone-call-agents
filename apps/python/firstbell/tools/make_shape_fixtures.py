Why these are generated and not recorded.

Three of the defects this dispatcher guards against were found by placing real calls, and for
a while the recorded responses themselves were the fixtures. They are not any more. The
upstream maintainer requires that no real-call artifact sit in the tree, and that requirement
holds even for a call somebody placed to their own phone using a reserved number, which is
what these were. So the recordings stay where they were made, outside this repository, and the
linked page publishes them with the transcript of each call and a shortened id. The receipt
files are on neither surface; the counts they produced are in evidence/recorded-calls.json.

That leaves a real question: if the fixture is authored, what stops it from being whatever
shape makes the tests pass?

The answer is that these are not hand-written. They are emitted by `calle_double`, and the
double's likeness to the production API is itself measured, by `tools/double_conformance.py`
against those recorded responses, and gated by
`test_the_double_emits_every_field_the_real_api_returns`. Every field, type, vocabulary and
timestamp relation in the files below therefore comes from something checked against
production rather than from anybody's memory of it.

What is authored, and should be read as authored: the words spoken. The Tamil and English
turns here were written for this fixture. They are not a transcript of anything, and nothing
in the suite treats them as evidence about what a real conversation contained. The claim that
CALL-E honours a requested locale is not made by these files; it is made by the receipts, and
the test that reads the Tamil here is named for what it actually checks, which is our own
reader.

Determinism. The double is pinned to a fixed clock and its ids come from a counter, so the same
call sequence produces byte-identical output every run. `--check` is what the drift test uses,
and it is the reason a hand edit to one of these files cannot survive.
