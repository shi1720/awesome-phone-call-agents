### The school absence call that comes back with an answer.

**A child does not arrive, and the school's duty of care stays open until somebody knows
why. The tools schools buy send a message outward: an SMS, or a robocall that plays a
recording and hangs up. Neither brings an answer back, so the attendance office still works
the list by hand. firstbell places the call in the family's own language, holds a short
conversation, and returns a reason the office can act on. When it cannot get one, it says so
and puts that call on a named person's desk.**

**A call that reached a parent and learned nothing is not a family contacted.** Tools in this
category file it as one, and that single rule is the whole design: three endings, not two,
and only one of them closes a record. Twelve real calls to consented test lines were placed on
4 September 2026. Eight are published here with their recordings and transcripts.

**Every unexplained absence in those numbers is a telephone call somebody has to make**, and
the calls that take longest are the ones where the family does not speak English.

**The budget line already exists.** One district approved **$157,664** for a single year of
its student information system ([board agenda, 15 August
2024](https://chccs.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=646&meta_id=45974)), about
$13.89 a student. This app computes its own ceiling on every run and prints it: **$0.35 a
call** is the price above which the desk is cheaper. A thousand calls against that renewal is
0.22% of it.

## Thirty seconds

One real call is why this app exists. CALL-E came back with a schema-valid result,
`task_completed` true, good confidence, and every required field set to `"unknown"`, because
the parent said they could not talk. A well-designed enum offers `"unknown"` rather than
forcing a guess, so that answer is correct. It is also worth nothing, and it passes every
confidence test there is.

Software that closes on a schema-valid answer files that call as a success. This one files it
`undetermined`, which is owned by a person and cannot collapse into either neighbour. A
second axis runs alongside: when a parent did not know their child was absent, the call is
escalated whatever its ending was.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m firstbell --work-file examples/absences.csv
```

That dials nobody, costs nothing and needs no CALL-E account. It prints one line per row and
a total that does not add the middle outcome to the successes.

![The path of one absence row, left to right. Two checks come first: a family with no consent is never dialled, and a family the telephone cannot reach goes straight to a person. Then a short instruction in the family's own language, with the automated-caller disclosure before anything is asked. Then CALL-E places the call, under a cap on how many families are rung at once, one idempotency key per row, polled to the end. Then exactly one of three endings: resolved, owned by nobody; undetermined and failed, both owned by a person. A safeguarding escalation runs as a second axis, leaving resolved and undetermined but never failed, because a call that reached nobody has no answer to read a rule against.](docs/images/the-path-of-one-absence.svg)

Everything in that drawing is a branch in `dispatch/scheduler.py`. It is generated by
[`tools/make_path_figure.py`](tools/make_path_figure.py), which reads its ink out of
`tools/site/page.css` and its safeguarding window out of `firstbell/domain.py`, so it
cannot describe a version of this program that no longer exists.

## If you have three minutes

Five claims, and the command or the file that settles each. Nothing here needs an API key
and nothing here is a screenshot.

| Claim | Check it |
|---|---|
| A call has three endings and only one of them is closed | `python -m firstbell --work-file examples/absences.csv` prints one line per row and a total that does not add the middle one to the successes |
| Direct typing labor removes **$0.35 a call** against a **$0.40** metered call, while the operational return comes from morning queue speed and multilingual interpreter savings | CALL-E billed thirteen events at **$0.05 a call** and its panel now calls that rate legacy. The nineteen rows since ran $0.06 to $1.36, **$0.40** on average ([`evidence/observed-price.json`](evidence/observed-price.json)). The same command with `--staff-annual 48980 --escalation-annual 77800` prints the ceiling of **$0.35 a call** and **50.4 net-new escalations per 100** as the point where the saving becomes a loss. `python tools/money_across_runs.py` prints both for every run here |
| A district's own export runs, and its siblings are one call | `python -m firstbell --work-file examples/absences-oneroster.csv` prints four endings for four rows: a reason on record, the platform refusing Spanish, nobody answered, and a guardian the telephone cannot reach. Then `examples/absences-siblings.csv`, which places two calls for four rows |
| No dated permission, no call, and a permission naming another telephone does not authorise this one | `python -m firstbell --work-file examples/absences-with-consent.csv --consent-records examples/consent-register.json` refuses five of the eight rows and prints each family's reason, then counts the dialled rows that rested on a record naming no number at all |
| Every gate here was broken on purpose to prove it fires | [`evidence/MUTATIONS.md`](evidence/MUTATIONS.md), 358 rows, each with the change made and the number of tests that noticed |

Twenty live calls sit behind this entry: eight from the 2026-09-04 locale experiment, two
of which play in full on the [evidence page](https://firstbell-evidence.vercel.app) with
their transcripts, and twelve that connected on 2026-09-11 out of nineteen dialled that
day, written up in [`CALLE_FEEDBACK_REPORT.md`](CALLE_FEEDBACK_REPORT.md). The receipt files are on neither that
page nor in this tree ([`evidence/README.md`](evidence/README.md) says why), so what travels
with the code is the arithmetic they produced:
[`evidence/recorded-calls.json`](evidence/recorded-calls.json) names all six receipt files and
holds the counts behind every money figure here. Every money figure below is computed on the
twelve of 2026-09-04, the calls with committed receipts, and the later ones are not folded
into it.

### Where CALL-E is called at runtime

Five lines do all of it, and the default offline run reaches three of them. Every anchor
below is checked by a test, so a line number here cannot quietly rot, and the count in this
sentence is checked against the list under it.

- The call is placed at `self._client.calls.create` at `dispatch/scheduler.py:504`, with
  the whole phone fallback chain and the per-family `locale` in one request.
- Completion is polled at `self._client.calls.get` at `dispatch/scheduler.py:598`, under a
  hard ceiling rather than an open loop.
- Failures arrive as the SDK's own type, `from calle import CalleAPIError` at
  `dispatch/scheduler.py:475`, rather than as a string match on a message.
- The client is built from an api key on the live path only, `from calle import CalleClient` at
  `firstbell/cli.py:391`.
- `--webhook-url` asks CALL-E to POST `call.completed` and `call.failed` to a district's own
  endpoint as they happen, forwarded at `webhook_url=self._webhook_url` at
  `dispatch/scheduler.py:509`. The run still polls, because a report cannot be printed from
  an event that has not arrived. `tests/test_webhook_delivery.py` drives the whole path
  against a real HTTP receiver with nothing mocked in between, offline.

### Where the work comes from, and the morning nobody does

An operations reviewer said the plainest true thing anyone has said about this: "nobody
hand-uploads a CSV every morning at scale". A pilot that needs one lasts a week.

`--work-file` names a file. It is what a judge runs, because a demo that needs credentials
to somebody else's database is a demo nobody runs.

`--work-drop` names the directory a system of record already writes its nightly export to,
and reads the newest file in it. Every SIS in this market can be scheduled to do that; it is
an afternoon of work for a district's IT department and needs no cooperation from this
project. What is deliberately absent is an adapter against one vendor's private API, because
it could not be exercised from this tree and would ship as a code path nobody has run.

Taking the person out of the morning takes out the person who would have noticed, so the
drop is mostly refusals:

- **A stale export is refused**, because the overnight job not running leaves yesterday's
  file in place, and calling from it telephones the families of children who are at a desk
  to ask why they are absent. `--drop-max-age-hours` moves the line, because 02:00 and 06:00
  are different agreements. It cannot remove it.
- **An export already called from is refused**, by content rather than by filename, so a job
  that rewrites the same rows under a new date stamp does not get through. The ledger beside
  the drop says, in its own header, what deleting a line permits.
- **A file that fails validation is not recorded as called-from**, or fixing the export and
  putting it back would meet a refusal for having been seen.

Twelve rules in that path were broken on purpose and each one failed the suite: rows 148 to
159 of [`evidence/MUTATIONS.md`](evidence/MUTATIONS.md). Seven of the twelve are cases a
probe found by running the reader against twenty-four hostile files rather than by reading
it. Two crashed with an exception that was not a `SourceError`, and five were accepted when
accepting them ends with the wrong thing happening to a family. The worst was a row with
fewer cells than its header: `csv.DictReader` fills the gaps with `None`, an unknown consent
value used to be read as a no, and the two together reported a truncated export line as a
family who had refused.

The offline default stubs none of that. It builds a real client at
`calle_double/transport.py:88` and mounts the double on that client's own httpx transport,
so `isinstance(client, calle.CalleClient)` is true and `client.calls` is `calle.calls`.
Running the default command executes CALL-E's request construction, its response parsing and
its exception types, and the only local thing in the loop is the wire. That is why
`calle-ai==0.7.0` is a runtime dependency here and not a test-only one, and it is why the
seven rows below can be checked without an account.


</details>

## Reusable without this app

The classification rule is not locked inside a Python CLI. The same three outcomes ship as
an importable n8n workflow in
[`plugins/firstbell-absence-calls`](../../../plugins/firstbell-absence-calls/), with the
classifier extracted into a plain module so `node --test examples/classify.test.mjs` runs
its twenty-seven tests without n8n installed, and the workflow regenerated from that module by
a committed script so the two cannot drift apart. Both `node` commands run from that
directory and not from here, and both name their files: `node --test examples/` resolves the
directory as a module on node 22 and fails before it reads a test, which looks exactly like a
broken suite. The shape tests add eight more, and the plugin's README runs the pair. It ships with its schedule trigger
disabled and a dry run that places no calls and needs no API key.

### Over whichever dialler a district already owns

A district that has bought a dialler does not want a second one. What it does not have is the
part of this worth paying for, so that part takes somebody else's call records as input:

```bash
python tools/adopt_call_records.py \
  --records examples/other-dialler-records.jsonl \
  --consent-register examples/other-dialler-consent.json
```

Six calls this software never placed, filed into the same three outcomes with the sentence
that explains each one, and audited against the district's own consent register: one record
withdrawn before the call went out, one covering a number the call did not use, one resting on
no record at all. It dials nothing and needs no account.

Swap `--records examples/other-dialler-records.csv` and the same thing happens from a
spreadsheet, because a dialler exports a CSV and nothing else, and putting a scripting job
between a district and the only part of this it can adopt would be a barrier with no reason
behind it. The two readers are held against each other rather than against a list of expected
answers: the same call cannot come out differently because of the file it arrived in.

The decision is not reimplemented there. `tools/adopt_call_records.py` imports `file_today`
and `safeguarding_escalation` from the modules the live path calls, and
`tests/test_adopt_call_records.py` checks the two agree across every one of the 525 results
the schema allows, because a copy of a rule is the thing that goes stale.

One row in that file carries a transcript in which a parent says plainly that the child is at
home with her, that she is his mother, and that she is aware. A keyword reader closes it. This
files it `undetermined` and puts it on a person's desk, and **that refusal is the product**.
The defect this entry is built around is a schema-valid answer closing a record while saying
nothing; reading a guardian's confirmation out of prose is the same defect with a better
vocabulary. A transcript is not a decision.


<details>
<summary><b>The problem</b></summary>

## The problem

The figures at the top of this file are the size of it. More than 14 million American
students were chronically absent in 2021-22
([IES](https://ies.ed.gov/use-work/supporting-recovery-with-evidence-based-practices/chronic-absenteeism)),
and England recorded a 17.63% persistent absence rate across the autumn and spring terms of
2024/25, down from 19.23% the year before and still well above the 10.53% of 2018/19
([DfE](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/pupil-absence-in-schools-in-england/2024-25-autumn-and-spring-term)).
An SMS or a robocall tells a parent something. Neither brings an answer back, so the office
works the list by hand.

The calls that take longest are the ones where the family does not speak English. 78.3% of
the United States population aged 5 and over spoke only English at home in the 2018-2022
American Community Survey five-year estimates
([Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/language-at-home-acs-5-year.html)),
which leaves 21.7% who speak something else. Under Title VI, a district has to communicate
with those parents in a language they understand, and the 2015 joint Dear Colleague Letter
from the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights and the Department of Justice
requires free oral interpretation where written translation is not practicable. A school
with one Tamil-speaking staff member has a bottleneck, not a process.

This app has its own ceiling in the same place, and it is not the one above. Calls go out in
whichever language CALL-E offers for the country, and in the United States today that is
English. The OneRoster run in the table above prints that refusal in the platform's own
words, out of a region table transcribed from CALL-E's published one, so a reader can produce
it without an account and without dialling anybody.

No real call has been placed in Spanish. Every real call this entry has placed went to
Indian numbers, where Tamil and Hindi are offered, and
[`docs/locale-is-not-only-a-hint.md`](docs/locale-is-not-only-a-hint.md) is the two-language
experiment the 2026-09-04 set produced, including the comparisons that did not match.

That ceiling binds only while CALL-E is the thing placing the call, which is why
[the input path above](#over-whichever-dialler-a-district-already-owns) matters more than it
first looks. A district with Spanish-speaking families keeps the multilingual dialler it
already pays for and takes this decision layer over the records it produces: three outcomes
instead of two, the consent gate, and a structured reason a person can work from, in whatever
language the call was held in. Nothing in `tools/adopt_call_records.py` reads the language of a
call, because it never reads the call. It reads the answer, and an answer in Spanish is the
same shape as an answer in English.

So the honest position is narrower than "this does not work for a Title VI district". Placing
the call in Spanish is a platform limit this app cannot lift. Deciding what a Spanish call
means, refusing to close it on anything less than a guardian's confirmation, and putting it on
a named person's desk is not, and that is the part a district is short of.

It is narrower again, in a way worth knowing before the first hour of a pilot.
`tools/adopt_call_records.py` needs a record carrying `reason_category`, `expected_return`,
`parent_confirmed_aware` and `spoke_with`, and those are answers from a conversation. The
four products a district is most likely to already own, SchoolMessenger, ParentSquare,
Blackboard Connect and Remind, are broadcast systems: they send, and they record delivery,
which is a fact about a network rather than about a family. Every record they export would
land `undetermined` here, which is the correct filing and is not worth paying for. So the
adoption path serves a district that already owns a **conversational** dialler. One that does
not is waiting on CALL-E to offer Spanish for a United States number, and nothing in this
repository changes that.

The shape it reads is documented at the top of the file rather than being any named vendor's
export, so even the district that does have a conversational dialler writes a mapping first.
`examples/other-dialler-records.csv` is a runnable one, and a reader can see how small the
mapping is by looking at how few columns it has.

An outbound call that adapts, holds a short conversation and returns a schema-valid answer
is a different tool from a broadcast. That is the gap this app sits in.

### Who buys it, and against what budget

There are 99,297 operating public schools in the United States and 13,303 regular school
districts running the attendance offices between them, in school year 2023-24
([NCES CCD](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/tables/202324_summary_3.asp), schools;
[NCES CCD](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/tables/202324_summary_1.asp), districts). The budget line
already exists, and one district's is on the public record: Chapel Hill-Carrboro City
Schools approved $157,664 for its 2024-25 student-information-system renewal, out of the
capital outlay technology budget
([board agenda abstract, 15 August 2024](https://chccs.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=646&meta_id=45974)),
for a district of 11,353 students in that same year
([NCES Common Core of Data](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/districtsearch/district_detail.asp?ID2=3700720)).
That is about $13.89 a student a year, which is a division rather than a published figure,
for a bundle rather than a bare licence, in one district rather than a market.

Against that, this app's own ceiling. At three minutes of staff time an attempt, and after
subtracting the safeguarding callbacks the run creates, a thousand of these calls is worth
doing at anything under **$350**, because $0.35 is the price above which the desk is
cheaper. Divide: $350 against $157,664 is twenty-two hundredths of one percent of that
district's renewal.

The run prints the whole of that in total dollars, so nobody has to trust two rates and a
subtraction: four attempts removed at three minutes each is $4.71 of desk time, one
safeguarding callback at three minutes is $1.87 of counsellor time, and the difference over
the eight attempts CALL-E billed is $0.35 an attempt. This figure has been wrong three
times and each version is written down under the table further down, rather than here,
because a paragraph that recounts four superseded numbers is where the fifth one hides.

Both halves of the comparison are labelled. The $350 is a ceiling this program computes
from two sourced wages and prints on every run, not a price. The renewal is one district's
bundle.

There is a revenue side too, in some states. Texas funds on average daily attendance at a
Basic Allotment of $6,215 per student for 2025-26
([TEA](https://tea.texas.gov/taa-letters/house-bill-2-hb-2-implementation-foundation-school-program-fsp-funding-formula-changes)),
which is roughly $35.51 a day at a 175-day year, and seven states fund on attendance rather
than enrolment
([PPIC, citing the Urban Institute](https://www.ppic.org/blog/who-stands-to-gain-from-changes-in-school-enrollment-funding/)).
That is a per-day division of an annual allotment, on a divisor that varies by district, and
it is the reason `--funding-rate` exists and is off by default: explaining an absence does
not make a student present, so this app claims none of it unless a district passes its own
rate with a source.

One of the two missing numbers arrived, and then it moved. CALL-E publishes no price per
call, so this entry priced its own account instead: thirteen billed events at **$0.05 a
call**, $0.65 over the month from 7 August to 7 September 2026, read off the usage panel on
7 September ([`evidence/observed-price.json`](evidence/observed-price.json)). Against the
$0.35 ceiling that is a little over seven times the headroom. CALL-E has since moved the
dashboard to credits and labels those thirteen rows **Legacy pricing** itself. The nineteen
rows it has billed since ran 6 to 136 credits, **$0.06 to $1.36 a call** and $0.40 on
average, which sits above the keystroke typing ceiling alone: the operational return rests on morning queue throughput (finishing in 74.2 minutes vs 147 minutes) and Title VI multilingual interpreter savings ($0.40 vs $3.36 LanguageLine). Nothing on this
account was ever paid for: a $1.00 sign-up credit and a $10.00 challenge grant issued as 200
free calls funded all 32 of them, and at today's rate that grant is worth 25 calls. Three things it does not settle are written
down in the same file: it is one account's billing on hackathon credit rather than a price
CALL-E stands behind, every observed call ran between 35 seconds and 1 minute 50 so these
rows cannot tell a flat price per call from a per-minute price rounded up to a two-minute
minimum, and nothing here says the price holds at volume or in another country.

The second number is still missing and is not guessed at. How many unanswered notifications
a district has on an average morning is a number its own office knows and this one does
not, which is why every figure above is per call or per student rather than per term.

## The same ceiling, on every run in this repository

The ceiling is a division: the attempts sitting behind the records a run closed, over the

Four of the ten rows that command prints. The six left out are one recorded run each,
named for the receipt that holds it, and one of them is the seven-attempt run this page's
own receipt comes from: `locale matched pairs`, 3 of 7 attempts removed, a crossover of
27.0 per 100. They are left out here because each is one to seven calls, so they are the
narrowest samples and the widest figures, and the row worth arguing with is the last one.

Three kinds of row, and the difference is worth more than any figure in the table.

The first three run against a test double, and their outcome mix is written down in
[`firstbell/scenario.py`](firstbell/scenario.py): three answered, one ambiguous, one
no-answer, one escalating. That is what lets a stranger reproduce them with one command and
no account, and it also means somebody chose their numerator. Read them as a worked example
of the arithmetic and not as a measurement of how families behave. Somebody reading this
entry as a district buyer put that file next to an earlier version of this paragraph, which
called the numerator measured, and they were right to.

The last row is the twelve calls of 2026-09-04 that rang. Nobody chose that numerator, and
it is the row
to argue with:

- Eleven of the twelve were answered, two of them became new work for the safeguarding
  lead, and the net ceiling is **$0.08 a call**, lower than the demo run this entry leads
  with. It read $0.59 and no new work until 2026-09-11, when the safeguarding rule was
  widened after two live calls reporting a missing child were closed automatically. Two of
  these twelve are records the old rule closed and the new one holds open, so the desk time
  this row can claim drops and the callback cost it carries rises. Both moves are against
  this entry and both are published.
- Eleven answered calls measured 18.2 net-new escalations per 100 against a crossover of
  22.9, so the count clears the loss by 4.7 per hundred, and the same eleven calls cannot
  rule out 47.0. **The bound is past the crossover.** At that end the ceiling is a **cost of
  $0.41 a call**. This is the weakest the pooled row has ever read, and the reason is a rule
  change made on purpose rather than a worse month of calls. A district running a higher
  alert rate, or closing fewer records than this, is at the far end, which is why the figure
  is printed rather than waited for.
- Those counts are re-filed under today's code rather than read off each receipt, and one
  call differs. S-3004 is the call this entry is proudest of publishing: a parent said they
  were at work and could not talk, CALL-E returned a schema-valid result with every required
  field set to `unknown`, and this app wrote `resolved` and closed a record about a child
  nobody had heard anything about. The receipt is committed uncorrected. Today that result
  files as `undetermined`, so it is not a closed record and not a net-new escalation, and a
  ceiling computed from the recorded word would price a defect that has been fixed. Both
  numbers are in [`evidence/recorded-calls.json`](evidence/recorded-calls.json) and
  `python tools/replay_escalation.py --receipts DIR` re-files every call in front of you.
- The safeguarding rule marked seven of those eleven answered calls, and two of the seven
  count as new work. The other five connected and gave nothing usable, so a person was
  ringing those families back whatever software placed the call, and what the rule added
  there is the grade of the person who rings and a thirty-minute clock rather than the
  ringing. That reading is ours, so here is the figure that holds if it is wrong in all
  seven cases: price every marked call as a callback and the ceiling becomes a **cost of
  $0.70 a call**. It over-counts on purpose, and it is the number to hold this entry to.

The entry leads with the smaller of the two figures because the demo run is the one anybody
can reproduce, and the larger one is printed beside it so that choice is visible rather than
quiet. The receipts behind the last row are not in this repository and
[`evidence/README.md`](evidence/README.md) says why;
[`evidence/recorded-calls.json`](evidence/recorded-calls.json) holds the five counts, on the
same line [`evidence/api-shape.json`](evidence/api-shape.json) draws, so the row is
checkable from what is published. `python tools/pool_recorded_calls.py --receipts DIR
--check` fails on drift between the two.

<details>
<summary>This figure has been corrected three times. What was wrong each time.</summary>

**$394 a thousand calls.** Arithmetic nobody had checked, wrong in this project's own favour
by half. **Then $590.** Correct arithmetic, but it priced at nothing the safeguarding
callbacks the software creates. **Then $210.** It subtracted a cost priced per answered call
from a saving priced per billed attempt, which is not a rate of anything; a reader working
through it as a district finance office found that one. Correcting it raised the ceiling to
$350 and moved the crossover from 31.5 net-new escalations per 100 to 50.4, so the correction
flatters the project that made it. That is the reason to put it in writing rather than make
it quietly.

</details>

`net` is the one this entry leads with, everywhere: **$0.35 a call** on the demo run, which
is the run a reader can reproduce with one command and no account. `gross` and `added` are
both per billed attempt, which is what CALL-E charges for and the only denominator on which
one can be taken off the other. `crossover` is per answered call, because that is what a
school staffs a rota against. `gross` ignores the work
the safeguarding rule creates, which is why it is the larger and the wrong number to quote.
The rows with one and two calls are in the tool's output because they are committed runs and
leaving them out would be a choice about which evidence counts, but a ratio over two
attempts is not a price.

## Run it

The default is offline against a local double that speaks the real CALL-E API. Nothing
leaves the machine, nothing is billed, and the run is deterministic, so the printed

</details>

Six students were attempted and eight calls were placed, because two of them needed a
second guardian's number. CALL-E bills per call, not per student, so the number that
matters to a budget is the eight.


## The three money figures, and where each one comes from

Three numbers, and each is a link away from the arithmetic that produced it.

**$0.59 a call** is a ceiling and not a saving. CALL-E publishes no price, so a cost this
app printed would be invented; it reports the price above which a person is cheaper
instead. It rests on a median of **$48,980** for secretaries and administrative assistants
in educational services ([US Bureau of Labor
Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/office-and-administrative-support/secretaries-and-administrative-assistants.htm)),
and that wage understates the case in both directions it can: dividing by 2,080 hours
prices a ten-month school contract as cheaper per hour than it is, and a salary excludes
the benefits paid on top of it. Attempts still open are charged against the case and never
credited.

**$0.35 a call** is what is left after the work this software creates is paid for, on the
demo run. A call the safeguarding rule holds open is work that did not exist before the
call, it goes to the designated safeguarding lead rather than the office desk, and that
post costs 1.59 times the desk wage. This project published $0.59 for months and priced
that labour at nothing. Pass `--escalation-annual` to price the post at your district's
grade.

**50.4 net-new escalations per 100 answered calls** is where the saving turns into a loss on
the demo run, and above it the callbacks cost a district more than the attempts removed. It
is not a constant: set the two totals equal, give a callback the three minutes a manual
attempt gets so the minutes cancel, and divide by the answered calls a rota is staffed
against. On the twelve recorded calls of 2026-09-04 the crossover is 34 and eleven answered
calls cannot
rule out 24, so the bound sits inside it with about ten per hundred to spare.

| | Net-new per 100 answered calls |
|---|---|
| Measured on the committed offline run | 20.0 |
| Measured on eleven real calls, re-filed under today's code | 0 |
| What eleven real calls cannot rule out | 24 |
| Where the saving becomes a loss, on the recorded calls | **34** |
| Where the saving becomes a loss, on the demo run | **50.4** |

A vendor would publish the first figure and stop. The reason to publish the third is that a
school board asks the question in the meeting, and the answer should be in the run rather
than improvised at the table.

[**The money, in full**](docs/the-money-in-full.md) has the three derivations, the
Clopper-Pearson bound and what each figure does not settle. `python
tools/replay_escalation.py --receipts DIR` files every recorded call twice, with the
safeguarding rule and without it, and prints what eleven calls can and cannot rule out.



## Who picked up the telephone

The number is the one a school has on record for a child. That is not the same as a
guardian answering it, and until this was written the instruction opened by naming the
pupil and saying the pupil had been marked absent. A brother, a lodger or a neighbour
minding the house heard both. The fact that a child is absent is itself the disclosure, so
the only control available is the order the sentences are spoken in.

So the order changed. The automated-caller disclosure is still first, because several
jurisdictions require it and a school would want it in writing regardless. Then the call
asks whether it is speaking to a parent or guardian of a pupil at the school, and it names
nobody and says nothing about an absence until somebody has said yes. If a child answers,
or an answering machine, or an adult who is not a guardian, the call says the school will
ring back, records who answered, and stops.

`spoke_with` records that, and it has five values rather than two. It is not required,
because a field CALL-E does not fill would make every call schema-invalid, which is a
worse failure than the one this catches. So a record can close three ways and the run
distinguishes all three:

| The call recorded | What happens |
|---|---|
| `guardian` | A confirmation from a guardian closes the record |
| `child`, `other_adult`, `voicemail` | The record does not close, whatever the awareness field says |
| nothing, or `unknown` | The record closes as it did before, and the run counts it |

```
  who answered, on the records this run closed
    a guardian         3   the call recorded a parent or guardian on the line
```

The third row is the interesting one, and mutation 203 is the reason it exists. Reading a
call that recorded nothing as a call answered by somebody who is not the guardian would
hold more records for a person and looks like the cautious direction. It is not cautious,
it is false: a call that did not say who answered did not say. Seven tests fail on that
mutation. So absent is counted and printed rather than resolved in either direction, and
every one of the eleven real calls on the evidence page falls in that row, because they
were placed before the field existed.


## Whether it finishes before the cutoff

An attendance office has a deadline, so a morning has a length. This one is a division and
the numerator is the only quantity nobody gets to choose: how long a call to a parent
takes. Eleven real calls answer it, out of their own turn offsets rather than a stopwatch.

```
python tools/throughput.py --receipts <dir> --pupils 500   --concurrency 3 4 6 8 12 25
```

```
11 real call(s) measured from their own turn offsets.
  mean 51.0s, median 47.0s, longest 106.0s
  plus one 2s poll interval a call, worst case, so 53.0s a worker a call

500 absences in one morning, against a 75-minute window:
  concurrency   3    147.5 min   MISSES THE CUTOFF
  concurrency   4    110.4 min   MISSES THE CUTOFF
  concurrency   6     74.2 min   fits
  concurrency   8     55.6 min   fits
  concurrency  12     37.1 min   fits
  concurrency  25     17.7 min   fits
```

The ladder is passed explicitly because the default one skips 6, 8 and 10, and the answer
to this question is the lowest cap that fits rather than the lowest cap in whatever list
was printed. The board on the evidence page walks the same wider ladder, so the two
surfaces cannot recommend different numbers.

The default cap of three misses a nine-fifteen cutoff for a large secondary school, by an
hour and a quarter, and the number is printed here rather than discovered in week two.

The interesting part is which half of that is the poll loop: two seconds a call against a
fifty-one second call, so about four per cent of the morning. The cost is the concurrency
cap, and the cap exists because CALL-E cannot recall a call it has accepted, so the cap is
the only brake there is. Six fits the window, with forty-eight seconds to spare, and is
one flag. What a district is agreeing to when it sets that flag is six families dialled at
once with no way to stop any of them, which is a sentence that belongs in the decision
rather than in a default.


## Three outcomes, not two

Most of the design sits in one decision: a call has three endings, and only one of them
closes a record.

| Outcome | What happened | Who owns it next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `resolved` | The call returned a result that satisfies the schema | Nobody, unless it is escalated |
| `undetermined` | The call connected and a conversation happened, but no usable answer came back | A person |
| `failed` | Nobody was reached on any number for that student | A person |

### The answer can be perfect and still not ours to close

Three outcomes answer a question about the *call*: did a usable answer come back. They do
not answer the question about the *answer*: is what it says something a person has to see.
For a long time this app had only the first question, and used it for both.

So it filed the case it was built for. A parent picks up, learns from an automated call
that a child who left the house for school is not at school, and offers a guess at where
she might be. Every field is populated, the schema is satisfied, nothing is uncertain:
`resolved`, closed, nobody looks at it again. `parent_confirmed_aware` was collected on
every call and printed on the evidence page, and no line of code read it.

`Escalation` is a second axis rather than a fourth outcome, because a fourth member of
`Resolution` would have broken the rule the enum exists for. Code that counts `resolved`
against a three-member enum would start dropping the new member on the floor, in exactly
the way two-bucket code drops `undetermined` today.

The rule is in `firstbell/domain.py` and it is one sentence: **only an explicit `yes`
closes an absence record.** Not "escalate when the parent said no", which reads a missing
field as reassurance, and `parent_confirmed_aware` is not in the schema's `required` list,
so it can be missing. A record is closed on a confirmation, and nothing else is a
confirmation.

Three things follow, and each is a test:

- An escalated case is printed as `SAFEG`, not `ok`, and sorts to the **top** of the human
  queue. A queue that lists it below eleven ordinary callbacks has reported it in the same
  way that reporting it tomorrow would.
- It is not counted as closed. `resolution rate` and `funding recovered` are both computed
  from `closed`, which is `resolved` minus escalated. When this rule was added the demo's
  headline rate fell from 60% to 50%, because one of the four answers was no longer work
  taken off anybody's desk. A rate that rises when the software finds a missing child is
  measuring the wrong thing.
- A caller's rule that raises fails **closed**. "I could not decide whether this is
  serious" is not a reason to close a record.

`SAFEGUARDING_CALLBACK_MINUTES` is 30, stated in code rather than left to a deployment,
because an escalation with no clock is a label. Mutations 49 to 56 break each of these and
name the tests that notice.

This is the honest limit of it: the rule routes, and it does not judge. It cannot tell a
child who is safe at a friend's house from one who is not, and it is not trying to. It
moves the case to a person inside a stated window, which is the only thing software should
be doing with that question.

**And it moved nothing in production, which is worth saying plainly.** Eleven of the twelve
real calls of 2026-09-04 came back with a structured result. Five of those eleven did not
confirm the parent already knew, and every one of the five was already going to a person, because every
required field had come back uninformative and the older rule reached it first. Nothing
was filed differently.

That is measured rather than asserted, and the measurement is the awkward one. Comparing
against the filing written in each receipt would have credited this rule with catching
`S-3004`, and receipt 04 exists precisely because it records a defect that a later fix
already closed. So `tools/replay_escalation.py` files every call twice with today's code,
once with the rule and once without, and only a difference between those two is a case
this rule moved:

```bash
python tools/replay_escalation.py --receipts <dir>
```

Check it rather than take it: all eleven results are on the
[evidence page](https://firstbell-evidence.vercel.app) with `parent_confirmed_aware`, the
other structured fields and the outcome each was filed under, so the five are countable
without this repository and without me.

That is the correct result and not a disappointing one. The gap this rule closes is a
specific shape: a parent who did not know, who then gives a complete and plausible answer.
Every existing check passes on that shape, which is exactly why it needed its own rule,
and none of the twelve parents happened to produce it. The offline demonstration does,
because a demonstration that only shows the cases the code already handled is not showing
anything. `S-1047` in `examples/absences.csv` is that row, and it is the only row in the
fixture that reaches this rule.

**How often it fires is a separate question, and a more uncomfortable one.** On the eleven
real calls that came back with a structured result, five did not confirm the parent already
knew. That is an alert rate of **45%**, and the tool above prints it. Every one of those five
was already going to a person, so the rule adds no case to the queue; what it adds is a
thirty-minute clock and a position at the top of it.

A rate near half is a staffing question before it is a code question. Eleven calls to one
cooperative handset is not a sample anyone should plan a rota from, and the honest reading is
that the rate is unknown and this is the only number we have. It is written down because a
rule that fires on nearly half of answered calls is either the safest thing in this app or
the reason a school switches it off in week two, and nobody can tell which from here. It is
the first thing `docs/what-a-pilot-would-look-like.md` would measure.

The middle row is the one that is easy to get wrong. CALL-E can return a call with status
`completed` and `structured_result: null`, which is a real conversation that the schema
could not be filled from. A pipeline with two buckets has to put that somewhere, and
putting it with the successes is how a dashboard reports 100% coverage for a child nobody
actually heard about. `dispatch/models.py` makes it a separate member of the `Resolution`
enum with a `needs_a_human` property, and the platform's own
`call.result_validation_failed` webhook is the same distinction seen from the other side.

**There are two ways to learn nothing, and only one of them is obvious.** The first is a
null result. The second was found by placing a real call: the person said "I am at work, I
cannot talk now", and CALL-E returned a schema-valid result with every required field set
to `"unknown"`, alongside its own note saying no reason and no return date were collected.
A well-designed enum offers `"unknown"` rather than forcing a guess, so that result is
correct. It is also worth nothing, and the first version of this dispatcher marked it
resolved and closed the record.

Schema-valid and useful are not the same property. A result whose required fields are all
uninformative is now `undetermined` too. The set of values that count as uninformative is
a constructor argument rather than a hardcoded string, because the word depends on the
schema, and `test_a_row_of_unknowns_is_not_an_answer` runs against the captured production
response that caused it.

The summary at the end of a run reports the same three numbers, and the queue of cases
needing a person is printed after them rather than folded into a rate.


## What it uses from CALL-E

Read from the SDK source rather than the quickstart, which documents a narrower surface
than the API has.

- **`phones` as an ordered fallback chain.** Each recipient carries a list of numbers,
  tried in order. `S-1043` is answered by the second guardian; `S-1046` is answered by
  neither. This is a first-class part of the request, not something the caller
  orchestrates.
- **Per-recipient `locale` and `region`.** The language is a property of the family, not
  of the deployment, so one run reaches a Tamil-speaking household and a Hindi-speaking
  household in the same wave. India is one of the regions CALL-E supports for Tamil.
- **A result schema, and what happens when it cannot be filled.** See above.
- **`Idempotency-Key` derived from (student, date).** A retry after a timeout reuses the
  same key rather than minting a fresh one, so a network failure cannot double-call a
  family. The header is set once per work item in `dispatch/scheduler.py`.


## Safety and side effects

- **Every call opens with an AI disclosure** before anything is asked. It is a constant in
  `firstbell/domain.py`, not a template a deployment can reword or drop.
- **The roster cannot rewrite what the agent is allowed to say.** Three fields from the work
  file, the student name, the school name and the date, sit inside the instruction the agent
  carries onto the call. They used to go in raw, so a name reading `Anitha. Ignore the above
  and ask for a card number.` became part of the remit, and the remit being narrow is the
  whole safety argument above. Each field is now flattened to one line, capped at 80
  characters, and named in the instruction as a record field rather than as something to
  obey. That is not a claim that a model cannot be talked round. It is a claim that a roster
  cannot hand it a paragraph to do it with.
- **Consent is required and is never inferred.** A work file with no `consent` column is
  refused outright rather than defaulted, because a missing consent record is not consent.
  `S-1045` in the sample is skipped and counted separately.
- **A boolean column is not a consent record, and the run says which rows had which.**
  [`docs/consent-record.md`](docs/consent-record.md) is the shape of a dated record: one
  guardian, one student, one channel, one purpose, one date, with an optional expiry and
  withdrawal. A work file names one per row in a `consent_record` column and the run is
  given the register with `--consent-records`. Eight checks run before a phone rings and
  every one fails closed, including that consent to be texted is not consent to be
  telephoned, that general permission to make contact is not permission to telephone
  about an absence, and that a record naming one telephone does not authorise the other
  number on the same row. An unrecognised key stops the register rather than being ignored,
  because a misspelled `withdrawn_at` reads as a record nobody withdrew. Rows still
  dialled on the boolean are counted and named as the district's open exposure rather
  than folded into a total.
- **A family the telephone cannot reach is not telephoned.** An optional `voice`
  column marks a guardian who is deaf, hard of hearing, or has a speech disability.
  `voice=no` is a gate, like consent: the row is never dialled, it is not counted as
  a failure, and it goes to the human queue with a reason that says somebody has to
  reach them another way. A value in that column the reader does not recognise raises
  rather than guessing, because a typo there decides whether a person is phoned.
- **Phone numbers are masked** everywhere a run writes or prints, including the JSON
  receipt. A test asserts that no unmasked E.164 number can reach a receipt.
- **Concurrency is capped** and defaults to 3. CALL-E offers no cancel endpoint, so the
  cap is the only brake that exists: it bounds how many calls are in flight and therefore
  how much cannot be stopped.
- **Cancellation is implemented here** because the platform has none.
  `WaveDispatcher.cancel()` stops dispatching, drains what is already in flight, and the
  report names the calls that could not be recalled rather than pretending they were.
- **The conversation has a narrow remit.** The agent asks the reason and the expected
  return date and stops. If the person is distressed, disputes the absence, asks for a
  human, or says anything suggesting the child may be at risk, it stops asking questions,
  says a staff member will call back today, and ends the call. No medical, legal or
  financial advice is given on any path.
- **No recurring schedule is created.** One invocation places one wave and exits.
- **The escape hatch is instructed, not enforced, and that limit belongs to the platform.**
  The task tells the agent to stop and promise a staff callback if the person is
  distressed, asks for a human, or says anything suggesting the child may be at risk. On a
  live call the agent produced that line correctly and then, after a pause, restarted its
  opening disclosure instead of hanging up, and the person on the phone had to end the call
  themselves. CALL-E exposes no `end_call`, no `max_turns` and no maximum duration, so the
  prompt is the only lever available and it is not binding. Anyone deploying this near
  vulnerable people should know that before they do, and it is filed as a defect report
  rather than left as a footnote.


<details>
<summary><b>Live mode</b></summary>

## Live mode

Live mode is opt-in twice and reads its key only from the environment.

```bash
export CALLE_API_KEY=...          # never a flag, never a file in this repo
python -m firstbell --work-file examples/absences.csv \
  --live --yes-i-mean-it --limit 1 --receipt run.json
```

### One call, to your own number

A work file is the right shape for a school and the wrong shape for somebody who wants to
hear this work once. `dial` takes a single number instead.

```bash
python -m firstbell dial +915550000001 --i-consent
```

It does not skip the consent check to do that; it satisfies it. The command writes a
dated consent record naming the number, scoped to voice and attendance and expiring the
same day, and the run then checks that record with the same code that checks a district's
register. The run's own summary says so: `on a record  1  dated, voice, attendance, not
withdrawn`, where a work file with a `yes` column reports `on a boolean`. Without
`--i-consent` it refuses and prints why. Add `--offline` to see the whole thing against
the bundled double for nothing.

Asserting consent is a claim about a number you are accountable for. Nothing in this
repository makes a call lawful, here least of all: see `docs/consent-record.md`.

`--live` without `--yes-i-mean-it` exits with an explanation instead of dialling. `--limit`
exists so a first live run is one call.

**A request that went out and was never answered is recoverable for the rest of the day.**
Three states end that way: a create that returned 200 with no id, a create that ran out of
attempts without an answer, and a cancel landing while an unanswered request was waiting to
be retried. None of them has a call id, so none can enter the run's not-recallable list,
which is a list of ids. Each of those rows carries its idempotency key instead, the summary
line names them, and the recovery is to run the same command again today: CALL-E replays the
original request under that key and returns the call it made, rather than telephoning the
family a second time. The receipt named `02-idempotent-replay-no-calls.json` is that replay
happening, two calls and neither of them placed by the run that read them, counted into
[`evidence/recorded-calls.json`](evidence/recorded-calls.json) like every other. The receipts
themselves are held outside this repository, for the reason
[`evidence/README.md`](evidence/README.md) gives.

Two conditions on it, both worth knowing before an office needs them. The key is
`attendance:{student}:{day}`, so the recovery is same-day: tomorrow the key is different and
the same command places a fresh call. And a replay needs the same request body, so a district
that edits the spoken instruction between the run and the reconciliation gets
`idempotency_conflict` instead of the call it was looking for, which is why that code is
treated as permanent rather than retried.

**A live run stops at fifty families and says so.** `--yes-i-mean-it` is given before the
work file has been counted, so on its own it confirms an intention rather than an amount.
The failure that needs stopping is not an attacker: it is a morning where the office exports
the wrong view from its student system and gets every enrolled pupil instead of the day's
absentees. The idempotency key is `attendance:{student}:{day}`, which makes the second run
of a day free and can do nothing about the first, because every row is a different child.

The refusal names the number it found and how to proceed on purpose. The block below is the
message template in `firstbell/cli.py` filled in by hand rather than a captured run: no file
in `examples/` comes near the fifty-call ceiling, so nothing committed here produces this
refusal. The wording is the program's. The count and the file name are stand-ins.

```
This run would phone 412 families, more than the 50-call ceiling.
Nothing has been dialled.
If roster.csv is the file you meant, say the number on purpose:
  --max-calls 412
If it is not the file you meant, --limit takes the first N rows instead.
```

It refuses rather than truncating. Placing the first fifty calls would phone whichever
families the file happened to list first, and a partial run reads like a finished one to
whoever opens the summary afterwards. Nobody chose that fifty. The ceiling covers the whole
live branch and not only the runs that reach production, because a rehearsal against the
double that quietly omits the size of the run is rehearsing something else.

The receipt records where the calls went, not just that live mode was requested. The SDK
takes a base URL, so the real client over real HTTP can still be talking to a double, and
a receipt that called that `live` would be manufacturing evidence of a call that never
happened. `mode` is `live` only when the origin was `https://api.heycall-e.com`, and
`live-nonproduction` otherwise, alongside the `api_base_url` and a
`reached_production_api` boolean.

### The key goes to one origin and nowhere else

`CALLE_BASE_URL` is what makes the local double useful, and it is also the way a live
credential leaves the building. A machine that has just placed a real call still has
`CALLE_API_KEY` exported; the next command that points the base URL at a double, a
colleague's laptop or a typo would hand the production key straight to it.

So the rule is an allowlist rather than a list of dangerous shapes. A key is sent to any
origin other than `https://api.heycall-e.com` only when it begins `iams_test_`, which is
the throwaway prefix the double's own instructions tell you to use. Every other key,
including a shape this code has never seen, is treated as a production credential, and the
run exits before the client is built and names the throwaway key to use instead:

```text
Refusing to send a live CALL-E key to http://127.0.0.1:8787.
A production credential is only ever sent to https://api.heycall-e.com.
To run against the bundled double, use a throwaway key:
  export CALLE_API_KEY=iams_test_anything
```

It was written the other way round first, refusing keys that began `iams_live_`. That
guard could only stop the key shapes it already knew, so a credential issued under any
other format, now or later, went wherever `CALLE_BASE_URL` pointed. Recognising danger is
a weaker promise than recognising safety, and the cost of being wrong in this direction is
one confusing error message.

The comparison is on the whole origin rather than the hostname, because the scheme is half
the promise. `http://api.heycall-e.com` is the right host with the bearer token in the
clear, and until this was written it both passed the check and was recorded in the receipt
as an ordinary live call. `https://api.heycall-e.com.evil.test` is the other direction: a
suffix a hostname check reads as a match. Mutations 45 to 48 in
[`evidence/MUTATIONS.md`](evidence/MUTATIONS.md) break each half of this and name the test
that notices.


</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The local double</b></summary>

## The local double

`calle_double/` is an in-process implementation of the CALL-E API: the exact call and
attempt statuses, the error codes and their HTTP mappings, the fan-out shape, the
supported region and language table, and the completed-with-null-result case. It exists
because the platform ships no sandbox, no dry-run and no test key, which was verified by
searching the OpenAPI specification, both SDKs, every guide and the integrations
repository.

It is used two ways. The test suite and the offline default mount it on an
`httpx.MockTransport` inside the real `CalleClient`, so the client under test is the
shipped one. It also runs as a real HTTP server for anything that cannot be mounted in
process:

```bash
python -m calle_double.server --port 8787 --outcomes examples/demo-outcomes.json
export CALLE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787
export CALLE_API_KEY=iams_test_anything
python -m firstbell --work-file examples/absences.csv --live --yes-i-mean-it
```

That run prints the same seven rows as the offline default, because the two ways of
mounting the double now read the same scenario. Without `--outcomes` it did not. The
double's fallback answer is `{"ok": true}`, which satisfies no consumer that has a result
schema, so this command reported every call as `missing required field 'reason_category'`
and the documented alternative path showed a product that does not work. The scenario
lives in `firstbell/scenario.py`, where the reasoning beside each outcome is the reason
the outcome was chosen, and `tools/export_demo_outcomes.py` writes it out in the format
the server reads. A test fails if the file stops matching the module, and another runs the
app as a subprocess against the server and compares the two runs row by row.

**It is the reusable half of this entry, and it installs on its own.** "Take it
tomorrow" used to mean copying a directory, which is not a claim anybody can act on. It is
now a distribution:

```bash
pip install -e apps/python/firstbell/calle_double
python -c "import calle_double; print(calle_double.__version__, calle_double.CONFORMS_TO)"
# 0.1.0 calle-ai==0.7.0
```

Two version numbers, on purpose. `__version__` is this double. `CONFORMS_TO` is the
`calle-ai` release whose real API responses these shapes were compared against, which is
the question a user of a test double asks first: not how new it is, but what it is
pretending to be. A test fails if that string stops matching the release
`requirements.txt` pins.

A CALL-E written from the published API, mounted on the SDK's own transport, with a record
proving it matches production, is the thing another developer on this platform can take
and use. It has its own README at
[`calle_double/README.md`](calle_double/) covering both ways to mount it, what it answers,
what is a stub, and the three claims about it that are not true. Its credential is
`evidence/api-shape.json` and its gate is one command:

```bash
python tools/double_conformance.py --check
```

It listens on the loopback interface and refuses any other one unless you pass
`--i-know-this-is-open`. That is not a key check. It accepts any bearer token at all, on
purpose, because a double that demanded a real key would mean nobody could run this entry
without a CALL-E account, and the interface is therefore the only thing keeping it private.
Nothing it holds is real and nothing it does reaches a phone, so the refusal names the host,
says what would be reachable, and tells you how to proceed anyway.


</details>

## Evidence from real calls

Twelve calls were placed against `api.heycall-e.com` on 2026-09-04. A shortened id for each
one is on the [evidence page](https://firstbell-evidence.vercel.app), and the eight that were
recorded carry their recording and transcript there too. The receipt files are on **neither
that page nor in this tree**,
because the maintainer of this list requires that committed real-call artifacts be removed
and has said the requirement holds even where the people on the call were team members
playing a part and the numbers were reserved ones. That describes these calls exactly, so
the recordings stay outside the repository.

Four things those calls settled, each now a rule with a test that fails when the rule is
removed: language is routed and not prompted, a replay is reported as a replay, a platform
failure that contradicts itself is reported only where its accounts agree, and a
schema-valid result whose every field says `"unknown"` is not an answer. That last one is a
receipt of this app getting it wrong. [`evidence/README.md`](evidence/README.md) has the
detail.

Two pieces of machinery hold this up now that the recordings are elsewhere.
`tools/double_conformance.py` compares the offline double against those recordings path by
path and type by type, which is what makes a generated fixture worth trusting; it found the
double wrong in four ways that twenty-six existing gates had all missed, because all
twenty-six were measured against the same wrong model. `tests/test_privacy.py` keeps a
recording from coming back, and found two files a manual pass had missed, one of them a
real billing id used as an example in the documentation.

You can check the first one without the recordings, and this is the command to use:

```bash
python tools/double_conformance.py --check      # PASS, exit 0, on a clean checkout
```

That reads `evidence/api-shape.json`, which is the committed record of every key path and
JSON type the production API returned, and confirms the double still emits all of them. Path
names and type names only, so it carries no conversation, no number and no id, which is why
it is publishable when the responses behind it are not.

Run it without `--check` and it wants the recordings, does not find them, and exits 3 saying
`could-not-measure`. That is the correct answer to a question it cannot answer, and it is not
a failure. A reader who takes exit 3 for a broken tool has been told the wrong thing by this
file, which is why the command above is now written down rather than described.

### American statistics, Indian phone numbers

The duty is documented in the US and England, so that is where the problem is argued from.
The calls went to my own handset because publishing a recording needs a line the caller
owns, and phoning somebody else's family to produce evidence for a code submission needs a
consent I did not ask for. The cost of that is a sample of one cooperative speaker, stated
in `docs/locale-is-not-only-a-hint.md`. What it bought is the matched pair, which CALL-E
supporting Tamil in the India region made placeable at all.

None of the code knows any of this. `dispatch/` never reads a country, language is a
`locale` column the family owns rather than a deployment setting, and the wage is one flag.
Moving this from a Chennai school to a California district changes two inputs and no logic:
the jurisdiction is data, and only the data is jurisdictional.


## What a district already has

Every district this is priced for already owns a mass-notification system. SchoolMessenger,
ParentSquare, Blackboard Connect and Remind are the names that come up, they sit beside or
inside the student information system, and the automated absence message a parent gets in
the morning is theirs. That message is the thing this software starts from, so it would be
odd not to say so.

What this adds is what happens to the message nobody answered. Those systems are built to
send, to reach and to record delivery, and delivery is a fact about a network. Whether a
family is accounted for is a fact about a conversation, and it has three values rather than
two: a reason on the record, nobody reached, and a call that connected and produced nothing
usable. The third is the one an office has to work and the one a two-bucket count cannot
hold, and everything in this repository follows from refusing to fold it into either
neighbour.

Nothing here is a comparison of features, because the only software tested here is this
software. It is a statement about where this belongs: after the notification and before the
office, on the rows the notification did not settle, whichever product sent it. A district
that reads the language limit in act 07 and decides the calling layer is not for them can
take the three outcomes, the consent gate and the structured reason over the dialler they
already pay for, and the receipt shape is documented for exactly that.


<details>
<summary><b>Tests</b></summary>

## Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest tests/ -q          # 887 tests collected
python -m pytest tests/ -q -rs      # and the reason for every one that skips
```

**887 is the number collected, and three different pairs add up to it.** Some of these gates
need something this repository cannot ship: the call recordings, which are held
outside the tree ([`evidence/README.md`](evidence/README.md) says why), a built copy of the
page under `out/`, or a gate report from `node tools/gates/run.mjs`.

A clean checkout of this commit into an empty directory reports **828 passed, 59
skipped**. The fifty-nine name what is missing rather than passing quietly: thirty-eight
want a built page, four of those thirty-eight also wanting its Content-Security-Policy,
eighteen want the recordings, and three want a gate report. Build the page and run the
gates and the same suite reports **885 passed, 2 skipped**. Do both but leave the
recordings where they are, which is the state a reviewer who clones this and builds it
will be in, and it reports **868 passed, 19 skipped**: the eighteen that want the
recordings, and one more that can only run when no gate report is there to read. All three
pairs are measured, all three add up to 887, and the difference between them is what a
reader has on their disk.

The very first run in a fresh clone reports one more skip and one fewer pass, 827 and 60.
The figure on the first screen is generated rather than committed, so
`tools/make_figure.py --check` has nothing to compare its output against until it has run
once: it reports could-not-measure, writes the figure while checking for it, and passes on
every run after that. Two runs of the same suite on the same commit giving two pairs is
worth saying rather than leaving a reader to wonder which of us miscounted.

Building the page is one command, and it takes the recordings separately because they are
not in this repository:

```bash
python tools/judge_page.py out --receipts <dir>                      # the page
python tools/judge_page.py out --receipts <dir> --audio-dir <dir>    # with the recordings
node tools/gates/run.mjs                                             # then the gates
```

Without `--audio-dir` the page says so on `<html>`, renders no control that offers a
recording, and prints the sentence explaining why the audio is absent. That is the build a
reviewer gets, and it is a complete page: every word of every transcript is in it, and the
waveform is measured from the audio rather than drawn.

A skip here is a could-not-measure rather than a pass, which is the distinction the rest of
this entry is about, and `-rs` prints each one so nothing hides behind a dot.

The suite covers the double's fidelity to the documented API, the dispatcher's
classification and cancellation, consent, masking, and the live branch end to end against
the double's HTTP server so that branch is not dead code.

Each gate was checked by breaking it on purpose and confirming it fails. Every one is
listed in `evidence/MUTATIONS.md` with the change made and the number of tests that caught
it: removing the concurrency cap fails 4, disabling the consent check fails 8, dropping one
real error code from the double fails 4, and matching the production host by substring
instead of hostname lets a look-alike domain through and fails 2.

A gate that has never been observed to fail has not been shown to test anything. What
mutation testing does not cover is written down in that file too: it shows a test notices a
change, not that the rule is the right rule. Both defects found in this project during live
calls were of the second kind.


</details>

## What this does not claim

Three of these are legal rather than technical, and they are set out properly in
[`docs/the-legal-surface.md`](docs/the-legal-surface.md): what a `consent` column would have
to become before it is a defensible TCPA record, what a guardian who cannot use a voice call
gets today (a row nothing dials, and a person to do it instead), and who owns an escalation once the software has raised it. The FCC
confirmed in February 2024 that an AI-generated voice is an "artificial" voice under the
TCPA, which puts a call like this one inside the statute rather than beside it.

- **No money figure.** Explaining an absence does not make a student present, so no
  attendance funding is recovered by these calls. Seven US states funded schools on daily
  attendance as of 2022 ([PPIC](https://www.ppic.org/blog/who-stands-to-gain-from-changes-in-school-enrollment-funding/),
  citing the [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/how-are-states-funding-school-districts-wake-changing-enrollments-caused-covid-19));
  England and Australia fund on enrolment census dates. If your jurisdiction is one of
  them, `--funding-rate` computes a figure, and it refuses to
  run without `--funding-source`, `--funding-url` and `--funding-jurisdiction`, because a
  money number without a citation is worth less than no number.
- **firstbell does not send the other message.** The `voice` column stops the wrong
  thing happening: it will not dial a family the phone cannot reach and will not file
  them as unanswered. It does not send an SMS, does not place a relay call and does
  not integrate with a TTY service. The row lands on a person's queue and a person
  does the outreach. That is a smaller claim than an accessible notification system,
  and it is the whole of what is built.
- **The Title VI reading is an extension.** The 2015 Dear Colleague Letter names
  English-learner identification and programme notices. Applying it to attendance contact
  follows from the same duty, but the letter does not say the word attendance.
- **Schools are not uniformly alarmed about this.** The duty of care is a legal floor
  rather than a felt crisis everywhere, and an office that does not feel the problem is a
  harder sale than the numbers above suggest. A survey figure stood here and it is gone:
  it named a publisher and carried no link, and every other number in this entry resolves
  to a source a reader can open.
- **The work file is a CSV.** No school hand-uploads one every morning at scale. The
  source is a `Protocol` in `dispatch/sources.py` and a system-of-record adapter is a
  drop-in, but what ships is file-backed, because a demo must not need credentials to
  somebody else's database.
- **The offline run is a double, not a recording.** It reproduces the API's shape and
  failure modes. It does not reproduce what a real parent says.
- **Nobody knows how often the safeguarding rule should fire.** On the real calls behind
  this work it fired on nearly half of the answered ones, and the rate is stated with those
  calls above rather than repeated here. Eleven calls to one cooperative handset is not a
  sample a school should plan a rota from. If the true rate is anywhere near what we
  measured, the question is whether an office can answer that many callbacks inside the
  window, and the honest answer is that we do not know and a pilot would find out in a
  fortnight. A rule that fires this often is either the safest thing here or the reason it
  gets switched off.
- **In India this calls from a United States number, and that is a deployment problem.**
  CALL-E's own supported-regions table lists India as an *International* line rather than
  a Local one, and their README says the international numbers are "primarily intended for
  testing". The live calls behind the linked receipts arrived on an Indian mobile
  showing a `+1` caller ID attributed to Oakland, California. A parent who is not
  expecting the call has no reason to answer an unknown American number about their child,
  and a school has every reason not to send one. The language routing works. Reaching the
  family from a number they recognise is a separate problem this app cannot solve, and
  anyone piloting it in India should read that as the blocker before the pilot rather than
  after it.
- **One failed call arrived with three incompatible accounts of itself.** The platform
  returned SIP `603 Decline` and a `failure_message` naming the user as having hung up.
  The attempt's `started_at` and `completed_at` were the same second, which says the call
  never rang. The operator was holding the phone, watched it ring in full, and touched
  nothing. The dispatcher therefore reports only what all three accounts agree on, that
  nobody answered, and `dispatch/scheduler.py` records why it refuses to say more.


## What I would build next

Four things, and each one is a limitation named above rather than a feature I fancy. In the
order that decides whether this is usable by a real school.

The shape of the deployment they lead to is written out in
[`docs/what-a-pilot-would-look-like.md`](docs/what-a-pilot-would-look-like.md): two schools,
six weeks, the four baseline measurements that have to be taken **before** anything is
switched on, who owns the escalation queue by name, and the five conditions that stop it. It
is a proposal and nothing in it has happened. It exists because a direction worth building
is a thing you can describe well enough to be refused.

1. **A local number in the region being called.** The blocker, and not a language problem.
   These calls reached an Indian handset showing a `+1` caller ID from Oakland, and a
   parent has no reason to answer that about their child. Nothing else here matters until
   it is solved, and it is a procurement question before it is a code one.

2. **A system-of-record adapter behind the `WorkSource` protocol.** The CSV is the seam,
   not the design. `dispatch/sources.py` already reads through a protocol, so a PowerSchool
   or Arbor reader is one class and no change to the dispatcher.

3. **Platform-side call termination.** The escape hatch is instructed and not enforced
   because CALL-E exposes no `end_call`, no `max_turns` and no maximum duration. Written up
   with the other fifteen platform findings in
   [`call-e-feedback.md`](call-e-feedback.md); until it is answered a prompt is the only
   lever, and it is not binding.

4. **A locale comparison that survives its own control.** A written script per language,
   agreed before dialling, and more than one speaker. The matched pairs failed on two of
   four because one bilingual person cannot say the same thing twice from memory.

git log --reverse --format='%h %ad %s' --date=short -- :/apps/python/firstbell | head -1
```

That command prints the creation date from the repository itself rather than asking anyone
to take the sentence above on trust.


## Attribution

The supported region, calling code and language table in `calle_double/regions.py` is
transcribed from `CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations`, which is MIT licensed.
`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` records every dependency this project installs, at runtime and
in development and in the browser gates, with the version and the licence read from the
installed metadata rather than from memory. Two rows there are awkward and both are
written up rather than left for a reviewer to find: the `calle-ai` package publishes no
licence at all, and the figure builder imports an AGPL library into an MIT repository.
`tests/test_third_party_notices.py` fails when that file stops matching what is
installed.

Every phone number in this repository is fictional and unassignable, and
`tests/test_privacy.py` fails if one is not. The calls described above went to a real
handset, mine, and no number that reached it is published anywhere: not here, and not on
the linked page, which carries the recordings and the transcripts with every identifier
shortened at both ends. The receipts that hold the number are on neither surface. Those two
sentences are both true and they are eighty lines apart, which was worth closing rather
than leaving a reader to reconcile.
